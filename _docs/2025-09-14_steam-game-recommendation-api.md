# Steam Game Recommendation API Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-14

## Overview
Implementation of backend API endpoints to support the Steam game recommendation UI from PR #19.

## Requirements
- Support game search and metadata retrieval
- Handle recommendation submission with account context (AI/User/Admin)
- Implement like/unlike functionality
- Provide purchase history verification through existing ZKP system

## Tasks

### 1. Create Steam Games API Router
- [x] Create `/server/src/routes/games.ts`
- [x] Implement GET `/api/games/:steamAppId` endpoint
- [x] Implement GET `/api/games/:steamAppId/recommendations` endpoint
- [x] Add Steam API integration service

### 2. Update Recommendations API
- [x] Create POST `/api/games/recommendations` endpoint
- [x] Implement account type distinction
- [x] Add purchase history verification logic

### 3. Implement Like/Unlike Functionality
- [x] Create POST `/api/games/:id/like` endpoint
- [x] Create DELETE `/api/games/:id/like` endpoint
- [x] Handle unique constraint for user-recommendation pairs

### 4. Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for games router
- [x] Write unit tests for recommendation endpoints
- [x] Write integration tests for like/unlike functionality

### 5. Integration
- [x] Update server index.ts to include new routes
- [x] Seed script updated with sample game data
- [x] Test with real database using Docker Compose
- [x] Verify API endpoints are functional with seeded data
- [ ] Verify ZKP integration works with Chrome extension (separate testing needed)

## Technical Decisions
- Use new Prisma schema models (RecommendResult, RecommendResultLike, etc.)
- Keep existing /api/zkp endpoints for Chrome extension compatibility
- Implement proper error handling and validation using Zod
- Follow existing code patterns from items and categories routers

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/games/:steamAppId` | Get game metadata |
| GET | `/api/games/:steamAppId/recommendations` | Get recommendations for a game |
| POST | `/api/games/recommendations` | Submit new recommendation |
| POST | `/api/recommendations/:id/like` | Like a recommendation |
| DELETE | `/api/recommendations/:id/like` | Unlike a recommendation |

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features
1. **Steam Games API Router** (`/server/src/routes/games.ts`)
   - Game metadata retrieval endpoint
   - Recommendations listing with account type filtering
   - Purchase history verification through ZKP proofs
   - Like/unlike functionality with toggle support

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Full unit test suite for all endpoints
   - Mocked Prisma client for isolated testing
   - All tests passing (10/10)

3. **Data Seeding**
   - Sample games from Steam catalog
   - Multiple account types (human, ai, admin)
   - Pre-populated recommendations with Japanese and English text
   - Sample ZKP proofs for ownership verification

### Key Implementation Details
- Account type mapping: `ai` → `ai_agent`, `human` → `user` for UI compatibility
- Recommendation routes under `/api/games` namespace
- Like/unlike routes: `/api/games/:id/like` (not `/api/recommendations/:id/like`)
- Purchase history only shown for human accounts
- Existing `/api/zkp` endpoints preserved for Chrome extension

## Integration Testing Results

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL running via Docker Compose on port 5432
- Database: `zksteam_dev`
- Successfully seeded with sample data including:
  - 11 Steam games (Stardew Valley, DAVE THE DIVER, etc.)
  - 5 sample accounts (3 humans, 1 AI, 1 admin)
  - Multiple recommendations with Japanese text
  - Sample ZKP proofs

### API Testing Results
- Server running on port 8180 (Note: not default 3000)
- `/api/health` - ✅ Working
- `/api/games/413150` - ✅ Returns Stardew Valley details
- `/api/games/413150/recommendations` - ✅ Returns 2 recommendations with proper formatting

### Sample API Response
```json
{
  "id": "a15bb06a-458e-4af6-a903-a5a4a7ecbc88",
  "name": "DAVE THE DIVER",
  "description": "DAVE THE DIVERは、資源を集めて...",
  "accountType": "user",
  "accountName": "SamplePlayer1",
  "purchaseHistory": {
    "hasSourceGame": true,
    "hasRecommendedGame": false
  },
  "likes": 0,
  "isLiked": false
}
```

## Notes
- Existing ZKP endpoints at `/api/zkp` must remain functional for Chrome extension
- New schema uses `RecommendResult` instead of old `Recommendation` model
- Account types: human, ai, admin (as per seed data)
- Server defaults to port 8180 in development mode
